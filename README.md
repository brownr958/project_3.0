# UNC Data Science Boot Camp Final Project

### This is the final project for Ryan Brown, Austin Williams, Micah West, and Gregory Parker in the UNC Data Science Boot Camp. In this project, we used machine learning on data from house prices in Ames, Iowa. The goal was to make a house price calculator using a formula derived from that data. The data came with many fields, but only 11 were used with Random Forest to best predict the sales price of a house. Although the 11 fields used weren't the most accurate in predicting the sales price, the 11 we used are more practical when entering information on a house such as bedrooms and lot area. A flask app was used to take the 11 inputs from our HTML and insert them into the price formula. The calculated value was then sent back and displayed on our HTML page.
